The Rpi 3 and 3b have wifi on chip, to connect to a neighboring wifi : 

1. Scan wifi : sudo iwlist wlan0 scan

2. Obtain the ESSID of the desired wifi

3. Edit to config file : sudo nano /etc/wpa_supplicant/wpa_supplicant.conf

4. Add the wifi login credentials at the bottom of the file : 

	network={
		ssid="The_ESSID_from_earlier"
		psk="Your_wifi_password"
	}

5. Reboot

6. To make sure its connected check if an ip address was given to wlan0 : ifconfig wlan0
