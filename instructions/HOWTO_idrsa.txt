The master should do these steps for every slave, in order to ssh without a password

1. First, check whether there are already keys on the computer : ls ~/.ssh

2. If you see files named id_rsa.pub or id_dsa.pub you have keys set up already, skip to 4. 

3. Generate new ssh keys (press enter for all questions) : ssh-keygen

4. Copy the public id to other devices : cat ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub | ssh <USERNAME>@<IP-ADDRESS> 'mkdir -p ~/.ssh && cat >> ~/.ssh/authorized_keys'

5. Repeat for other devices
