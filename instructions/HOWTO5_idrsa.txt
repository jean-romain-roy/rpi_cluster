The master should do these steps for every slave, in order to ssh without a password

1. First, check whether there are already keys on the computer : ls ~/.ssh

2. If you see files named id_rsa.pub or id_dsa.pub you have keys set up already, skip to 4. 

3. Generate new ssh keys pair (press enter for all questions) : ssh-keygen

4. Copy the public id to other devices : cat ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub | ssh <USERNAME>@<IP-ADDRESS> 'mkdir -p ~/.ssh && cat >> ~/.ssh/authorized_keys'

5. Repeat for every devices (each engines and master)

6. Create the following file ~/.ssh/config

7. Edit the config file and add all the information about each engine :

	Host master			# name of controller
		HostName 10.42.0.10
		User pi

	Host engine1			# name engine 1
		HostName 10.42.0.11
		Port 22
		User pi

	Host engine2			# name engine 2
		Hostname 10.42.0.12
		Port 22
		User pi
