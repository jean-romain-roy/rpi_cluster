1. sudo nano /boot/config.txt

2. uncomment following two lines : 

	hdmi_force_hotplug=1
	hdmi_drive=2



- hdmi_force_hotplug=1: Forces to display through HDMI event if no HDMI screen is detected. Remember to re-comment this line if you need to display the Raspberry Pi on a different port than the HDMI.

- hdmi_drive=2: Trying to use HDMI mode rather than DVI mode, this allows you to solve certain sound problems.
